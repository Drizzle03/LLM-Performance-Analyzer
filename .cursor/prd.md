Product Requirements Document (PRD): Claude API vs. HyperClovaX API Performance Comparison
1. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of Anthropic's Claude API and Naver's HyperClovaX API in two key areas: question generation and report compilation. The evaluation will focus on the quality, speed, and cost of responses when used in a chatbot format and tested via a Command Line Interface (CLI). The system should generate high-quality questions based on user responses, produce detailed reports based on provided prompts, and track associated costs for each API.
2. Objectives

Primary Objective: Compare the performance of Claude API and HyperClovaX API in terms of:
Question Generation: Quality and relevance of questions generated based on user responses.
Report Compilation: Ability to produce high-quality, structured reports based on user prompts and conversation context.
Speed: Measure response time for question generation and report compilation.
Cost: Calculate and compare the cost per interaction (question generation and report creation) for both APIs.


Secondary Objective: Develop a CLI-based testing framework that can also support a chatbot interface for real-time user interaction.

3. Scope
In-Scope

Development of a CLI tool to test both APIs for question generation and report compilation.
A chatbot interface integrated with both APIs to handle user interactions and generate context-aware questions.
Metrics collection for:
Question quality (relevance, clarity, and context-awareness).
Report quality (structure, coherence, and adherence to prompt).
Response time (latency for generating questions and reports).
Cost per API call (based on input/output tokens or other pricing models).


Support for natural language processing in English and Korean to accommodate HyperClovaX’s strengths in Korean-language tasks.

Out-of-Scope

Advanced UI development (e.g., web or mobile app interfaces beyond a basic chatbot).
Integration with other LLMs or APIs not specified (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).
Real-time collaboration features or multi-user support.
Extensive error handling for edge cases unrelated to core API performance.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 CLI Testing Framework

Description: A command-line tool to automate testing of both APIs for question generation and report compilation.
Features:
Input Handling: Accept user-defined prompts or predefined test cases (e.g., JSON or text files) for consistent testing.
API Integration: Connect to Claude API (via Anthropic SDK) and HyperClovaX API (via Naver’s SDK or HTTP endpoints).
Test Scenarios:
Generate 5–10 follow-up questions based on a user’s response to an initial prompt.
Compile a report (500–1000 words) based on a given prompt and conversation history.


Metrics Collection:
Log response time (in milliseconds) for each API call.
Capture token usage (input/output tokens) for cost calculation.
Save generated questions and reports for quality evaluation.


Output: Export results to a CSV or JSON file with metrics (e.g., response time, token count, cost, and quality scores).



4.2 Chatbot Interface

Description: A simple chatbot interface to interact with users, generate questions, and compile reports in real-time.
Features:
Interactive Dialogue: Accept user inputs and generate context-aware follow-up questions using both APIs.
Language Support: Handle inputs and outputs in English and Korean.
Report Generation: Allow users to request a report based on the conversation history with a specific prompt (e.g., “Summarize our discussion in a detailed report”).
Feedback Mechanism: Enable users to rate question quality (e.g., 1–5 scale for relevance and clarity) for post-interaction analysis.
Cost Tracking: Display estimated cost per interaction based on API token usage or request count.



4.3 Metrics and Evaluation

Question Quality:
Criteria: Relevance to user input, clarity, and contextual appropriateness.
Evaluation: Manual scoring by testers (1–5 scale) and automated checks for keyword overlap with user input.


Report Quality:
Criteria: Structure (e.g., introduction, body, conclusion), coherence, and adherence to the prompt.
Evaluation: Manual review by testers and automated analysis using readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid).


Speed:
Measure latency for each API call (question generation and report compilation) in milliseconds.


Cost:
Calculate costs based on API pricing models (e.g., per 1,000 tokens for Claude, per request or token for HyperClovaX).
Log token counts or request counts for each interaction.
Provide a cost comparison summary in the final output.



5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The CLI tool and chatbot should handle up to 100 concurrent test cases without significant latency (>5 seconds per request).
Scalability: The system should support batch processing for large-scale testing (e.g., 1,000 test cases).
Reliability: Ensure API calls are retried (up to 3 attempts) in case of network failures or rate limits.
Security: Store API keys securely (e.g., environment variables or a secure vault) and avoid logging sensitive data.
Compatibility: The CLI tool should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The chatbot should be accessible via a terminal or a basic web interface.

6. Technical Requirements

Programming Language: Python (for CLI and chatbot implementation, leveraging libraries like anthropic for Claude and Naver’s SDK for HyperClovaX).
Dependencies:
anthropic: For Claude API integration.
requests or Naver’s SDK: For HyperClovaX API integration.
pandas or csv: For exporting test results.
time or timeit: For measuring response latency.
textstat: For automated report quality analysis (e.g., readability scores).


API Access:
Anthropic API key for Claude (obtainable from Anthropic’s console).
HyperClovaX API key (obtainable from Naver’s developer portal).


Environment: Use environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., .env) to manage API keys and endpoints.
Testing Framework: Use pytest for automated testing of the CLI tool’s functionality.

7. Testing Plan

Unit Tests: Validate API integrations, input parsing, and output formatting.
Integration Tests: Ensure seamless interaction between the CLI/chatbot and both APIs.
Performance Tests:
Run 100 test cases for question generation and report compilation.
Measure average latency and token usage.


Quality Evaluation:
Conduct manual reviews of 20–50 generated questions and reports per API.
Use automated metrics (e.g., keyword overlap, readability scores) for consistency.


Cost Analysis: Compare costs based on token usage or request counts for identical test cases.

8. Success Criteria

Question Generation: Both APIs generate questions with an average quality score of ≥4/5 (based on manual evaluation) and maintain relevance to user inputs.
Report Compilation: Reports achieve a readability score of ≥60 (Flesch-Kincaid) and adhere to provided prompts with ≥90% accuracy.
Speed: Average response time for question generation <2 seconds and report compilation <10 seconds.
Cost: Provide a clear cost comparison showing the cost per 1,000 tokens or requests for both APIs.
Usability: The CLI tool and chatbot are intuitive, with clear documentation and error messages.

9. Assumptions and Constraints

Assumptions:
Both APIs are accessible with valid keys during testing.
HyperClovaX supports English and Korean inputs effectively.
Token-based pricing models are available for cost calculations.


Constraints:
Limited to Claude and HyperClovaX APIs; no other LLMs will be tested.
Budget constraints may limit the number of API calls for testing.
Manual evaluation of quality may introduce subjectivity.



10. Deliverables

Week 4: Evaluate question and report quality, finalize cost analysis, and compile the final report.

12. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: API rate limits or downtime.
Mitigation: Implement retry logic and schedule tests during low-traffic periods.


Risk: Inconsistent quality evaluation due to subjectivity.
Mitigation: Use multiple evaluators and automated metrics for consistency.


Risk: Limited documentation for HyperClovaX API.
Mitigation: Engage with Naver’s developer support or community forums for clarification.



13. Stakeholders

Product Owner: Responsible for defining test cases and evaluating results.
Developers: Implement the CLI tool and chatbot interface.
Testers: Conduct manual quality evaluations and validate test results.
Finance Team: Review cost analysis for budgeting purposes.

14. Additional Notes

The system should be extensible to add more APIs in the future (e.g., via modular code design).
Consider using Apidog or similar tools for API testing and debugging during development, as they simplify request configuration and response validation.
Ensure compliance with API usage policies (e.g., Anthropic’s terms for Claude and Naver’s for HyperClovaX).
